# 🌀 **Neon Air Hockey**

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is currently a WIP!  
> ⚠️ **WebGL Limitations:** The WebGL demo may have limited visual effects, lighting, or physics accuracy due to WebGL constraints. For the full, high-speed experience, open the project directly in Unity.

**Neon Air Hockey** is a Unity project inspired by classic mobile air hockey games — but with a twist.  
This version breaks traditional limits with **uncapped physics**, **fast collisions**, and **wild rebound behavior**, creating a **chaotic, high-energy experience** that feels more like an arcade brawl than a calm match.

Get ready for **flashing lights**, **dynamic puck movement**, and a physics engine that refuses to behave!

## 💡 Features (so far)

- ⚡ **Uncapped Physics Simulation** — The puck doesn’t obey normal laws of speed or friction. Every bounce can send it flying unpredictably.  
- 🌈 **Neon Aesthetic** — Glowing tables, light trails, and electric colors for every hit and deflection.  
- 🧠 **AI Opponent** — A fast-reacting opponent that matches your chaos energy.  
- 🕹️ **Player Controls** — Smooth mouse or touch controls for precise (or not-so-precise) strikes.  
- 🔊 **Dynamic Sound Effects** — Impacts and ricochets that react to speed and direction.

## 🔮 Planned / WIP Features

- 🎮 Multiplayer support (local & online)  
- 💥 Power-ups and hazards (e.g., double puck, speed zones, sticky walls)  
- 🧊 Table variants — frictionless, bouncy, magnetic, and random physics modes  
- 🔥 Score streak multipliers based on puck velocity  
- 🌐 Cross-platform WebGL and mobile builds
