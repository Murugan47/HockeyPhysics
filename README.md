# 🌀 **Neon Air Hockey**

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is currently a WIP!  
> ⚠️ **WebGL Limitations:** The WebGL demo may have limited visual effects, lighting, or physics accuracy due to WebGL constraints. For the full, high-speed experience, open the project directly in Unity.

**Neon Air Hockey** is a Unity project inspired by classic mobile air hockey games — but with a twist.  
This version breaks traditional limits with **uncapped physics**, **fast collisions**, and **an AI that is buckwild**, creating a **goofy experience**.

DO NOT ENABLE BABY MODE IN THE SETTINGS. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS IN STORE FOR YOU!

## 💡 Features (so far)

- ⚡ **Uncapped Physics Simulation** — The puck doesn’t obey normal laws of speed or friction. Every bounce can send it flying unpredictably.   
- 🧠 **AI Opponent** — A fast-reacting opponent that matches your chaos energy.  
- 🕹️ **Player Controls** — Smooth mouse for precise (or not-so-precise) strikes.  
- 🔊 **Web Hosted** — Can be played at any time!.
